Found myself having trouble organizing my day-to-day tasks. Coded this website to be able to organize my day even if I do not have any internet access.

This to-do list website was made using Microsoft Visual Studio Code. It features the use of languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The css file is an external style sheet, not an
